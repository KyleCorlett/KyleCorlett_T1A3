## Chance Game

This is my terminal application built with Ruby. It is a Chance game with three options to use. These options will be a Magic 8 Ball, where the application gives you a space to write an answer, after you have entered in your text it runs a random number generator, then pulls the matching answer from a hash and displays the answer after and along side the question the user has inputted. The second option will be to roll a dice, the user will select roll the dice of the menu and the application will use a random number generator to generate a number between 1 and 6 and display it to the user. The last and final option will be a simple coin flip, where the user will select to flip the coin and the application will use a random number generator and match that number to a heads or tails in a hash and display it to the user. There will be a main menu where the user has the option to go into each little game, and then a sub menu for each game, with its own set of options and a way to get back to the main menu.

I am creating this program as some times you just need an extra hand deciding something, or cant quite figure out what to do, so you need something to push you in the right direction. This is for people who like me are very indecisive and poor at making decisions, I hope to help people who would end up starving because they couldn't decide what to have for dinner. People will be able to download my application and use it when they are in need of a quick decision.
